A mixing paintop that can be used to develop your own paintop.

In the below instructions, replace "MYPAINTOP", "mypaintop", and "Mypaintop" with the name
of your own painttop, capitalized correctly.

How to use:
	* Copy this directory and everything in it to koffice/krita/plugins/paintops/mypaintop
	* Run the following commands in the new mypainttop directory:
		* find . -type f -exec sed -i s/mixing/mypaintop/g {} +
		* find . -type f -exec sed -i s/MIXING/MYPAINTOP/g {} +
		* find . -type f -exec sed -i s/Mixing/Mypaintop/g {} +
		* ls ./* | awk '{print("mv "$1" "$1)}' | sed 's/mixing/mypaintop/2' | /bin/sh
	* Add the following line to koffice/krita/plugins/paintops/CMakeLists.txt:
		* add_subdirectory( mypaintop )
	* You now have a working paintop. You can compile to check that everything works,
	  or start adding code so that the paintop does something. You should also fix the
	  copyright notices at the top of all .h and .cpp files.
